## 💡 Key Concepts

### Color Palette
All elements use a cohesive ocean-themed color system:
- Deep Ocean Blue (very dark)
- Shallow Water Blue (light)
- Bioluminescent Cyan (glowing)
- Atlantean Gold (treasure)
- Sandy Beige (accents)

### Animation Philosophy
All animations follow natural ocean principles:
- **Floating** - Bubbles, creatures rise gently
- **Pulsing** - Glows and pearls breathe
- **Swaying** - Seaweed and coral sway
- **Swimming** - Fish move horizontally
- **Opening** - Treasure chest reveals

### Visual Hierarchy
Elements positioned to not block content:
- Decorations use background layers
- Opacity keeps them subtle (15-50%)
- `pointer-events-none` prevents interaction issues
- Content always remains readable
